## Tool Description

PSMBasedQuantificationTIMs is the PSMBasedQuantification variant for timsTOF runs.

## How does PSMBasedQuantificationTIMs work?

1. **Diffrences to normal quantification**

   On these instruments a peptide ion is a peak in two dimensions, retention time and ion mobility, so the tool extracts an intensity grid over that plane around every identification instead of a one dimensional ion chromatogram.

2. **Detection type**

   By default it locates the peak on the grid with a Gabor filter (a Gaussian envelope multiplied with a cosine wave, tuned in size, width, frequency and angle), then fits and integrates it.

3. **Output**

   The output has the same layout as the output of PSMBasedQuantification, so the downstream tools do not care which of the two produced it.

## Inputs

These inputs are needed to execute the tool:

| Flag | Meaning | Comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | one or more `.mzlite` files with ion mobility, or a directory that is searched for `*mzlite` | [MzMLToMzLite](./mzml-to-mzlite.md) |
| `-ii` | one or more `.qpsm` files in the FragPipe column layout, or a directory that is searched for `*.qpsm` |  |
| `-o` | the output directory, created when missing | - |
| `-d` | the SQLite peptide database | [PeptideDB](./peptide-db.md) |
| `-p` | the parameter file in JSON | [Github ProteomIQon Core](https://github.com/CSBiology/ProteomIQon/blob/dev/src/ProteomIQon/defaultParams/peptideSpectrumMatchingParams.json) |
| `-mf` | switch: pair files by base name instead of by position | - |
| `-dc` | switch: write diagnostic charts | - |
| `-z` | switch: pack the chart directory into a zip file and delete it | - |
| `-c` | number of runs quantified at the same time, default 1 | - |

- The tool refuses any instrument file whose name does not end in `.mzlite`. It always reads the `qpsm` files as the FragPipe layout written by `MsFraggerToPSM` (with Hyperscore and IonMobility columns), so the files from PSMStatistics do not fit here.
- With one file per flag the pair is used as given. With lists, the n-th mzlite file is paired with the n-th qpsm file unless you pass -mf, which pairs files by their base name and skips mzlite files without a partner.
- For every run the tool writes `run.quant`, tab separated with a header.
- With `-dc` the tool writes charts into `run_plots`, and `-z` packs that directory into `run_plots.zip` and deletes it.
- Delete an existing `run.quant` in the output directory before a rerun, the tool appends to it. Logs go to `PSMBasedQuantification_log.txt` and `run_log.txt` in the output directory.

## Parameter file

The parameter record is shared with PSMBasedQuantification. The following default values are specific to timsTOF runs.

### General settings

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PerformLabeledQuantification` | `Labeling.Unlabeled` | Label-free quantification of the identified ion. The three labeled modes follow PSMBasedQuantification and also quantify the corresponding partner ion. |
| `FragPipe` | `true` | Indicates that the qpsm file uses the FragPipe format produced by MsFraggerToPSM. Keep this setting at `true`. |
| `BaseLineCorrection` | `None` | Disables baseline subtraction. `Some { MaxIterations = 10; Lambda = 6; P = 0.05 }` enables asymmetric least-squares baseline correction. |

### XIC extraction

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `XicExtraction.ScanTimeWindow` | `2.0` | Half-width of the retention-time interval extracted around the identification, in the run's scan-time unit. |
| `XicExtraction.MzWindow_Da` | `Window.Estimate` | Half-width of the m/z window in Da. `Estimate` uses four times the MS1 mass error of the identifications; `Window.Fixed 0.07` specifies 0.07 Da. |
| `XicExtraction.XicProcessing` | `XicProcessing.Gabor3D gaborParams` | Locates peaks in the retention-time/ion-mobility grid with the Gabor settings listed below. `Wavelet` and `SecondDerivative` instead use the one-dimensional processing from PSMBasedQuantification. |
| `XicExtraction.TopKPSMs` | `None` | `Some k` limits peak placement to the k identifications with the highest `Hyperscore` for each peptide ion. |

### Gabor filter parameters

The kernel size must be greater than zero. Widths must be positive and finite; frequency and angle must also be finite.

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sizeX` | `41` | Kernel size along retention time, in grid bins. Half the size is the kernel radius, which expands the search area around the expected peak. |
| `sizeY` | `41` | Kernel size along ion mobility, in grid bins. |
| `sigmaX` | `8.0` | Gaussian envelope width along the first kernel axis, in bins. |
| `sigmaY` | `8.0` | Gaussian envelope width along the second kernel axis, in bins. |
| `frequency` | `2.0` | Frequency of the cosine wave inside the kernel. |
| `theta` | `0.06` | Kernel rotation in the plane, in radians. |

## Tool Description

PeptideSpectrumMatchingTIMs identifies peptides from timsTOF runs using precursor ion mobility data. It reads `.mzlite` files and applies a fragment-index search approach related to MSFragger. For mzlite or mzML searches without this TIMs-specific workflow, see [PeptideSpectrumMatching ↗](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/PeptideSpectrumMatching.html).

The program merges the mobility scans of each MS2 spectrum, selects candidate peptides from a fragment index, ranks their spectrum matches and generates one `.psm` result file for each run.

## How does PeptideSpectrumMatchingTIMs work?

1. **Combine ion mobility scans**

   A timsTOF mzlite MS2 spectrum stores peaks by mobility scan. Since the fragment ions inherit the precursor's mobility, the tool combines these scans before matching. Working from low to high m/z, it groups peaks lying within `--mobility-merge-ppm` of the first peak of the group. Group intensity is summed, while the representative m/z is intensity-weighted.

   The default merging width equals `FragmentTolerancePPM`. Setting `--mobility-merge-ppm 0` combines only exactly equal m/z values; it does *not* disable summation. Spectra without peak-level mobility information pass through unchanged. Separate PASEF measurements remain separate MS2 spectra.

2. **Build the target fragment index**

   The index stores theoretical b and y fragments for target peptides. Reversed decoys can share that index: a decoy b fragment maps to a target y fragment minus water, whereas a decoy y fragment maps to a target b fragment plus water.

   Only peptides in the measured runs' precursor-mass windows are indexed, accounting for isotope errors and precursor tolerance. Fragment masses are capped by the largest applicable precursor window plus 1 Da or the optional `-f` value, and never above the largest peptide mass in the database plus 1 Da. Each fragment entry occupies 4 bytes.

   ### Memory management: index slices

   With `-s`, the peptide table is divided into that many index slices, built and searched sequentially so only one slice is held in memory. Normally the spectra are reread for each slice. Adding `-k` caches preprocessed spectra instead (roughly 2.4 kB per spectrum and charge). Slicing changes memory and I/O requirements, not the results.

3. **Preprocess the spectra and retrieve candidates**

   For each spectrum, remove peaks near the precursor m/z, peaks below the `MinimumPeakRatio` fraction of the base peak, and isotope partners; then retain the `TopNPeaks` strongest peaks. The remaining peaks query the fragment index, while peptide candidates must fit the precursor mass for at least one configured isotope error.

   Precursor m/z and charge normally come from the mzlite input. Missing charge information triggers the configured `FallbackChargeStates`. The search retains the top `ReportedHitsPerLabel` targets and the same number of decoys.

   ### Index binning and duplicate-hit prevention

   Lookup operates on complete `FragmentIndexBinWidth` bins, which can extend the effective candidate-retrieval interval by up to one bin width on either side of the specified tolerance. Nearby peak tolerance ranges closer than a bin are merged using the stronger intensity, preventing repeated fragment counts during index lookup.

4. **Calculate and refine the hyperscore**

   The initial X!Tandem-style hyperscore is calculated using the BioFSharp.Mz implementation. With base-peak-relative intensities scaled to 100 and a minimum intensity floor of zero, the natural-log version is:

   `ln(sum of matched intensities) + ln(Nb!) + ln(Ny!)`

   `Nb` and `Ny` denote the counts of matched b and y fragments. For reported candidates, the tool repeats matching at the exact fragment tolerance. This second calculation determines `Hyperscore`, `MatchedIons` and hyperscore rank. `MinMatchedFragments` is checked against that exact match count.

5. **Model expectation values**

   The expectation-value model follows X!Tandem's approach, also used by MSFragger. For each spectrum, index-pass candidate scores with at least `MinFragmentsModelling` matched fragments populate a histogram with bins of width one on the X!Tandem score scale.

   The histogram score scale is `4 × log10(product-form hyperscore)`, equivalent to `4 / ln(10)` times the natural-log expression above. The fit discards candidates above a gap in the upper survival-function tail and fits a line to the log10 survival function, from half of the remaining candidate count down to ten survivors.

   When fewer than 200 candidates remain, the X!Tandem fallback is `10^(3.5 - 0.18 × x)`. Expectation values cannot go below `1e-15`. Importantly, `Expectscore` is evaluated using the *index-pass* hyperscore, whereas `Hyperscore` is the exact rescored value. Consequently, the two columns need not rank candidates identically.

6. **Compute classic scores and score differences**

   The reported targets and decoys also receive the SEQUEST-like score from PeptideSpectrumMatching and Andromeda-like and X!Tandem-like scores. The `NormDeltaBestToRest` and `NormDeltaNext` metrics account for both target and decoy forms of all peptides selected during index retrieval, including candidates subsequently removed by exact rescoring.

   In ordinary PeptideSpectrumMatching, these differences use all peptides in the precursor window. Therefore, those normalized delta values are **not directly comparable** between the two tools.

7. **Process multiple runs**

   With `-c`, the tool handles groups of runs concurrently, using one thread per run and one shared index per group. Building the index uses one worker per run. A new group starts only after all runs in the current group finish; the default is `-c 1`.

   The peptide database must contain **monoisotopic masses**. Classic rescoring accounts for much of the processing time, so increasing `ReportedHitsPerLabel` also increases runtime.

| `-d` | SQLite peptide database | [PeptideDB ↗](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/PeptideDB.html) |
| `-o` | Output directory, automatically created if absent | — |
| `-p` | JSON file containing search parameters | Parameters section below |
| `-c` | Concurrent runs (one thread per run) | Default: `1` |

## Outputs

Every input run generates `<run>.psm` in the output directory, as a header-containing, tab-delimited file. Existing PSM files are overwritten. Its data record is `Dto.PeptideSpectrumMatchingResult`, shared with PeptideSpectrumMatching.

The table contains 28 columns: 23 classic PSM columns and 5 TIMs-specific additions. `Label` is `1` for targets and `-1` for reversed decoys; `MissCleavages` is set to `-1` and recalculated by PSMStatistics.

### Identifiers and logs

`ScanNr` is the MS2 position after ordering spectra by scan time. For `PSMId`, spectrum-id spaces become hyphens and the suffix `_ScanNr_charge_rank` is added. Rank is determined by hyperscore within the reported target or decoy group for that spectrum.

The output folder also contains `PeptideSpectrumMatchingTIMs_log.txt` and one `<run>_log.txt` for each run.

**Downstream compatibility:** PSMStatistics can read these PSM results directly and uses `Hyperscore` and `Expectscore`, when present. Its `.qpsm` output does not yet retain ion mobility. Furthermore, [PSMBasedQuantificationTIMs ↗](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/PSMBasedQuantificationTIMs.html) currently expects the FragPipe-style columns generated by [MsFraggerToPSM ↗](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/MsFraggerToPSM.html). Quantification after identification with this tool therefore needs adaptations to those downstream tools.

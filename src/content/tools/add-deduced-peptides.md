## Tool Description

AddDeducedPeptides takes the protein groups of the combined inference and assigns them to every peptide present in each aligned `.quant` file, so that JoinQuantPepIonsWithProteins can join the transferred quantifications to proteins.

After alignment and AlignmentBasedQuantification, a run's `.quant` file holds peptides that were never identified in that run, so the run's `.prot` file from ProteinInference does not list them.

## How does AddDeducedPeptides work?

1. **Combine protein inference results**

   The tool reads all `.prot` files as one combined inference and does not pair them with `.quant` files by name.

   This requires ProteinInference to run over all runs together (`GroupFiles = true`). Each run's `.prot` file must carry identical scores and Q-values for a protein group.

2. **Validate protein group scores**

   If a protein group has different scores, the tool stops with the message:

   > If you are running this tool please infer proteins over all files

3. **Generate run-specific protein files**

   For every input `.quant` file, the tool creates a corresponding `.prot` file in the output directory.

   Each output is a tab-separated table with the columns of a ProteinInference result.

4. **Filter peptide associations**

   Each protein group retains its scores and Q-value. The `PeptideSequence` column lists only peptides present in the corresponding `.quant` file.

   Protein groups without matching peptides are removed.

5. **Continue downstream processing**

   JoinQuantPepIonsWithProteins reads the newly generated `.prot` file together with the scored `.quant` file from the same run.

## Inputs

These inputs are needed to execute the tool:

| Flag | Meaning | Comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | One or more aligned `.quant` files, or a directory searched for `*.quant` | [AlignmentBasedQuantification ↗](./alignment-based-quantification.md) |
| `-ii` | One or more `.prot` files, or a directory searched for `*.prot` | [Protein Inference ↗](./protein-inference.md) |
| `-o` | The output directory, created when missing | — |

- For AddDeducedPeptides there is no parameter file needed.
- Delete an existing output .prot file before a rerun, because the tool appends to it
- Logs go to AddDeducedPeptides_log.txt.

## Outputs

This Output is generated

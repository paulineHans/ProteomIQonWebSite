## Tool Description

PeptideDB digests the proteins of a FASTA file in silico and stores the resulting peptides, with their masses and modifications, in a SQLite database.

## How does PeptideDB work?

1. **Comparision**

   The search tools compare measured spectra against these peptides, so the digestion settings define the search space of the whole analysis.

2. **Algorithm**

   How the protease, the allowed missed cleavages, the length limits and the modifications shape that space is explained in the [BioFSharp.Mz](https://www.biofsharp.com/BioFSharp.Mz/) documentation, and the database layout is described on the same page.

## Inputs

These inputs are needed to execute the tool:

| Flag | Meaning | Comes from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-i` | one FASTA file (no directories) | choosen Proteome |
| `-o` | the output directory, created when missing | - |
| `-p` | the parameter file in JSON | [Github ProteomIQon Core](https://github.com/CSBiology/ProteomIQon/blob/dev/src/ProteomIQon/defaultParams/peptideDBParams.json) |

- The tool writes `Name.db` into the output directory, where Name comes from the parameter file.

- The database is read by

  - [PeptideSpectrumMatching](./peptide-spectrum-matching.md)
  - [PeptideSpectrumMatchingTIMs](./peptide-spectrum-matching-tims.md)
  - [PSMStatistics](./psm-statistics.md)
  - [MSFraggerToPSM](./ms-fragger-to-psm.md)
  - [PSMBasedQuantification](./psm-based-quantification.md)
  - [PSMBasedQuantificationTIMs](./psm-based-quantification-tims.md)
  - [AlignmentBasedQuantification](./alignment-based-quantification.md)
  - [Protein Inference](./protein-inference.md)

- When a `<Name>`.db already exists in the output directory and the parameters stored inside it equal the parameter file, the tool reuses that database and only makes sure its index is present.

- The output directory also receives PeptideDB_log.txt and `PeptideDB_Name_log.txt`.

## Parameter file

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Name` | AraTest | Name of the database and stem of the output file. |
| `ParseProteinIDRegexPattern` | id | How protein identifiers are taken from the FASTA headers. "id" (in any letter case, or an empty string) keeps the whole header line as the identifier. Any other value is a regular expression, and the matched part of the header becomes the identifier, for example "^\\S+" for the first word. |
| `Protease` | Protease.Trypsin | Enzyme used for the digestion. Other values are `Protease.Trypsin_P`, `Protease.LysC`, `Protease.LysC_P`, `Protease.Chymotrypsin` and `Protease.PepsinA`. |
| `MinMissedCleavages` | 0 | Lowest number of missed cleavage sites a peptide may have. |
| `MaxMissedCleavages` | 2 | Highest number of missed cleavage sites a peptide may have. |
| `MaxMass` | 15000.0 | Peptides above this mass in Da are dropped. |
| `MinPepLength` | 4 | Shortest peptide length kept, in residues. |
| `MaxPepLength` | 65 | Longest peptide length kept, in residues. |
| IsotopicMod | \[IsotopicMod.N15\] | Isotopic labels of the experiment. Each label adds a labeled variant of every peptide next to the unlabeled one. Use `[]` for an unlabeled experiment. Other values are `IsotopicMod.C13`, `IsotopicMod.O17`, `IsotopicMod.O18` and `IsotopicMod.D`. |
| `MassMode` | MassMode.Monoisotopic | Mass calculation, MassMode.Monoisotopic or MassMode.Average. |
| `FixedMods` | `[]` | Modifications applied to every matching residue. |
| `VariableMods` | `[Modification.Oxidation'Met'; Modification.Acetylation'ProtNTerm']` | Modifications that may or may not be present. Every allowed combination becomes its own database entry. |
| `VarModThreshold` | 4 | Maximum number of variable modifications on one peptide. |

- The available modifications are the cases of `ProteomIQon.Modification`, for example `Modification.Carbamidomethyl'Cys'` or `Modification.Phosphorylation'Ser'Thr'Tyr'`.
- The default file is [PeptideDB.json](https://github.com/CSBiology/ProteomIQon/blob/dev/src/ProteomIQon/defaultParams/peptideDBParams.json).
